As per the principles of SDN, it also separates the controlplane from 5G gNB and places it in two distinct controllers[5]. The Non-Real-Time RIC (Non-RT RIC) controls tasks withhigher latency (>\n\n文件: 2508.15595v1.pdf (第3页)\n内容: \n文本: execute the control functions provided in the CFR document.The codegen agent generates this interface API server usingknowledge from an internal API document which is present\n\n文件: 2508.15595v1.pdf (第3页)\n内容: \n文本: function does not have a direct matching function in the internalAPI. The codegen agent generates a wrapper function aroundthe internal API function which is most similar to support theadditional functionality required by the control function.\n\n文件: 2508.15595v1.pdf (第3页)\n内容: \n文本: validity of the generated interface server. This test code mayalso be provisioned by the NFsrc. If the interface server codethrows errors in this test, this error is fed back to the LLM toregenerate this code. The agent can do it multiple times untilthe correct version of the code is generated (Fig. 2 step 6).\n\n文件: 2508.15595v1.pdf (第4页)\n内容: \n文本: embeddings are fetched and are passed to the LLM. In theresponse generation phase, the LLM generates a reply to theinput query based on the retrieved text embeddings. In caseof the matching agent, the NF capability document and thecontrol function requirements from user are used as input\n\n文件: 2508.15595v1.pdf (第4页)\n内容: \n文本: then generates the CFR document with the matched gNB orAP control functions. This CFR document is then sent to gNBand AP. This information is received by the codegen agents oneach NFs. These agents generate the code required for creatingthe interface API server. Note that the API server is uniquefor every vendor. The agent tests the code until the correctversion is generated. Once this is successful it then sends a\n\n文件: 2508.15595v1.pdf (第4页)\n内容: \n文本: requirements using Claude 3.5 Sonnet [9]. We then used thesevariations as input to the matching agent and observed whetherit correctly matches them to the capabilities of the AP/gNBand how many attempts were required to achieve a correctmatch. Figure 4 shows the number of attempts and the totaltime required to match 60 requirements. The diameter of the\n\n文件: 2508.15595v1.pdf (第5页)\n内容: \n文本: of the circle represents the cost. We observe that the codegeneration was predominantly successful on the first attempt.Compared to the matching task, coding task is more complex.Here, the performance gap between Llama3.3 and GPT-4oincreases significantly. In this case, GPT-4o based agent is 10- diverse operational conditions. The performance of agentsalso depends on the availability of well-structured anddetailed capability and API documentation [10].• Considering real-world deployment of this framework,security of network functions might be affected by LLMspecific threat vectors. These might be direct or indirectprompt injection or context windows overloading [11]. Inour experiments, we observed that the size of the contextwindow matters for accuracy. If the number of controlfunctions in a single query is too large the models start\n\n文件: 2508.15595v1.pdf (第5页)\n内容: \n文本: cessfully augment the functions when clear and structuredinstructions were provided in the requirements.
